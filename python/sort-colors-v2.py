"""
This problem is also known as Dutch National Flag Problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem

Idea:
    - Count how many 0's and 1's
    - If a number is not in the range it should be, put this number in the range it should be
        and recursively use this definition for the number that will be replaced there.

time: O(n)
space: O(n)

In theory, this algorithm passes only 1 time in the array, but in practice I think it's a little bit more,
but it's less than 2 times. It's a weird algorithm ðŸ˜….
