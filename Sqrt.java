Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Square root of x is guaranteed to be a number between 0 and x, so that's our search space.
Let y be a number between 0 and x, if y*y is greater than x, then we know all elements greater than y
can be discarded from the solution. That's the key idea for the binary search approach because we can
cut big parts of the search space by doing this comparison.
