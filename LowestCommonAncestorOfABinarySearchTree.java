Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two
nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to
be a descendant of itself)."

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.

          lowestCommonAncestor = pSearchPointer; // Works because p != q, if p can be == q then should use min()
