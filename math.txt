Permutations vs arrangements vs combinations

Permutation: arrangements of elements in a specific order
Permutation with repetition: arrangements of elements in a specific order where chosing the same element
  multiple times is allowed
Combination: selection of objects where the order inside the group is not important
Arrangements: selection of objects where the order inside the group is important

reminder   quotient

dividend = divisor * quotient + remainder

XOR properties:

Commutative : A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
This is clear from the definition of XOR: it doesn't matter which way round you order the two inputs.

Associative : A ⊕ ( B ⊕ C ) = ( A ⊕ B ) ⊕ C
This means that XOR operations can be chained together and the order doesn't matter. If you aren't
convinced of the truth of this statement, try drawing the truth tables.

Identity element : A ⊕ 0 = A
This means that any value XOR'd with zero is left unchanged. 1 ^ 0 = 1 and 0 ^ 0 = 0

Self-inverse : A ⊕ A = 0
This means that any value XOR'd with itself gives zero.

Logarithmic properties:
log xy = log x + log y.
log x/y = log x - log y.
log a^m = m log a.
log_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b)

Proof of arithmetic progression sum formula
a: first element
d: common difference

S_n = (a + 0d) + (a + 1d) + (a + 2d) + ... + (a + (n - 2)d) + (a + (n - 1)d)
Note that first term + last term = second term + penultimate term

S_n = ( (a + 0d) + (a + (n - 1)d) ) * n / 2
S_n = (a_1 + a_n) * n / 2

OR

S_n = a * n + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n - 2) + (n - 1)) * d
S_n = a * n + ((n - 1) * n / 2) * d
S_n = n * (a + (n - 1) / 2 * d)
(it's normal to get decimal numbers in the middle)

Proof of geometric progression sum formula
a: first element
r: ratio

Formula 1 -> S_n = (a * r^0) + (a * r^1) + (a * r^2) + (a * r^3) + ... + (a * r^(n - 2)) + (a * r^(n - 1))

Multiply by `r` both sides
Formula 2 -> S_n * r = (a * r^1) + (a * r^2) + (a * r^3) + (a * r^4) + ... + (a * r^(n - 2)) + (a * r^(n - 1)) + (a * r^(n - 0))

Subtract Formula 2 by Formula 1
S_n * r - S_n = a * r^(n - 0) - a * r^0
S_n (r - 1) = a * (r^n - 1)
S_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

Fibonacci sequence recurrence relation proof | big O time complexity

T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2)
T(2) = 1
T(1) = 1
T(0) = 0

Approach 1, just expand the terms and see the pattern:

T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2)

T(n - 1) and T(n - 2) are very close values, so we can simplify the equation:
T(n) = 2T(n - 1)

Now we expand T(n - 1):
T(n) = 2*2*T(n - 2)
T(n) = 2*2*2*T(n - 3)

Approach 2, math equation tricks:

T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2)

T(n - 1) and T(n - 2) are very close values, so we can simplify the equation:
T(n) = 2T(n - 1)

Now we create the equation of T(n - 1) and successors:
T(n - 1) = 2T(n - 2)
T(n - 2) = 2T(n - 3)
T(n - 3) = 2T(n - 4)
...
T(n - (n - 3)) = 2T(n - (n - 2))
T(n - (n - 2)) = 2T(n - (n - 1))
T(2) = 1
T(1) = 1
T(0) = 0

Now the multiplication of all equations on the left side should be equal to the multiplication of all
equations on the right side:

T(n) * T(n - 1) * ... * T(n - (n - 3)) * T(2) * T(1)  =  2T(n - 1) * 2T(n - 2) * ... * 2T(n - (n - 3)) * T(2) * T(1)

We can cut T(n - 1), T(n - 2) and many other calls to the T function. At the end, we'll have T(n) = 2^n
