- I didn't use proper object oriented programming best practices
  - (The code in this repository is not the code I produced during the interview)
  - (I wasn't expecting this type of interview and I didn't practice that in Python)
  - From now on I'll be using Java in all interviews because from my experience all companies (big tech or not)
    will have at least one interview that is more related to OOP best practices than algorithms and data structures
- Bugs I didn't catch
- I didn't finish the coding challenge on time
